# Resources

A common place to keep helpful resources for informatics, data science, and more!

## Learning Resources

- [ML For Healthcare - MIT](https://mlhcmit.github.io) - Course Website for HST.956 at MIT, Machine Learning for Healthcare. Has slides and problem sets, as well as links to recorded lectures
- [StrataScratch](https://www.stratascratch.com) - LeetCode for Data Science. An interactive learning resource for learning to use SQL/Python to query and manipulate data tables

## Research

- [Consensus](https://consensus.app/search/) - A search platform using AI to "Aggregate and distill" findings from scientific research

## Regex

- [AutoRegex](https://www.autoregex.xyz) - An "english-regex" translator built on top of GPT-3. 
- [Regex Generator](https://regex-generator.olafneumann.org/?sampleText=2020-03-12T13%3A34%3A56.123Z%20INFO%20%20%5Borg.example.Class%5D%3A%20This%20is%20a%20%23simple%20%23logline%20containing%20a%20%27value%27.&flags=i&onlyPatterns=false&matchWholeLine=false&selection=) - A more traditional tool that allows use of sample text to interactively generate Regex

## Machine Learning

- [BertTopic](https://github.com/MaartenGr/BERTopic) - A topic modeling algorithm to disocver topics using BERT language transformer models
- [Ray Tune](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/index.html) - Automated Hypermparamter Tuning implemented in python for libraries like PyTorch, Tensorflow, and ScikitLearn
- [Opt_List](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/opt_list) - A compiled list of hyperparameters that have been produced by google for various machine learning libraries, that they have tried and found to be effective
- [MCA](https://pypi.org/project/mca/) - Multiple Correspondence Analysis is like PCA for categorical variables

## Python Specific

- [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org) - Creates an in-memory database which can be queried and mutated using SQL syntax. Provides APIs is Python, R, and Java
- [Polars](https://pola-rs.github.io/polars/py-polars/html/reference/) - Performant, multi-threaded Dataframe manipulation library; meant as a replacement for Pandas
- [PyGWalker](https://github.com/Kanaries/pygwalker) - A drag-and-drop library to graph a dataset for Explortatory Data Analysis within a Python environment. Also some mroe advanced features for feature selection etc..

## Other

- [SteamPipe](https://steampipe.io) - A Command Line tool that allows the use of SQL to access popular cloud services as well as useful APIs (Twitter, Reddit etc...)
- [Penpot](https://penpot.app) - Open-Source Design app, may be helpful for designing presentations, figures etc
- [RATH](https://docs.kanaries.net/rath/deployment) - A more advanced Tableau-like data visualization suite. A little tricky to put together as of this note (requires spinning it up via node)
- [Tad](https://github.com/antonycourtney/tad) - Open-Source tabular data viewer. Uses DuckDB to handle millions of rows with a handy GUI.
